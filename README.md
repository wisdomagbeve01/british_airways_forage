# Project Overview

This project aims to gain valuable insights into customer experiences with British Airways by utilizing web scraping techniques to collect reviews from Skytrax. The initial phase involved scraping extensive review data, focusing on sentiments and themes associated with the airline's services. After acquiring the dataset, I performed thorough data cleaning to address inconsistencies and prepare the data for analysis.

Using Python, I applied sentiment analysis and topic modeling to uncover key patterns and insights from the reviews, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement in customer service. The findings were then visualized through word clouds and charts to present a clear overview of customer sentiment.

In the second phase, I trained a machine learning model to predict customer booking behavior based on various features in the dataset. This involved exploring and preparing the dataset, selecting appropriate algorithms, and conducting cross-validation to evaluate model performance. The outcomes of this analysis were summarized in a concise PowerPoint slide, showcasing actionable insights and strategies for enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction.

Overall, this project combines data analytics and machine learning to inform British Airways' marketing and operational strategies, ultimately contributing to a better customer experience.
